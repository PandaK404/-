# Capturing the Human Figure Through a Wall



两个算法；

+  The first component is a coarse-to-fifine algorithm that effificiently scans 3D space looking for RF reflflections of various human limbs and generating 3D snapshots of those reflflections.
+ The second component exploits the fact that due to human motion, consecutive RF snap shots tend to expose different body parts and diverse perspectives of the same body part. Thus, this component introduces an algorithm that identififies human body parts from RF snapshots across time, and stitches multiple snapshots together to capture the human figure.
